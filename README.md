# Customer-Marketing-Data

## Project Overview

## Description
This project is centered around exploring and analyzing customer transaction data. The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** We conducted a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the dataset to gain insights into the data's structure, patterns, and anomalies.

- **Data Engineering:** Data preprocessing and feature engineering were performed to prepare the data for modeling.

- **Prediction with Machine Learning:** We employed machine learning techniques to build predictive models for specific tasks, such as churn prediction, sales forecasting, or customer behavior analysis.

- **Customer Segmentation:** We used clustering algorithms to segment customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and characteristics.

- **Product Recommendation:** Leveraging affinity rules and association analysis, we implemented a product recommendation system to improve cross-selling and customer satisfaction.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains customer transaction data. It includes information about customers, their purchases, and various other attributes.
